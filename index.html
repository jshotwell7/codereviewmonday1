<h1>Code Review for Monday</h1>
<body>
    <p>We learned about operators,conditional statements such as if else and else if.</p>
    <p>Also learned about different types of operators such as assignment, comparison, arithmetic, & string</p>
    <p>We also learned about different math functions such as math.floor, math.round & math.random</p>
    

    <h4>Things I'm not comfortable with:</h4>
    <ol>

        <li>Switch Statements</li>
        <button class="switchstatements" onclick="switchfunction()">Switch Statements</button>
        <script>
            function switchfunction() {
              alert("Having some trouble with Switch Statements! I get the method but it confuses me.");
            }
            </script>

        
        <li>Operators aren't hard, just need to keeep practicing on them</li>
        <button class="operators" onclick="opfunction()">Operators</button>
        <script>
            function opfunction() {
              alert("Having trouble with certain Operator assignments such as strict and logical operators that use boolean values!");
            }
            </script>

        <li>Loops are still difficult for me</li>
        <button class="loops" onclick="loopfunction()">Loops</button>
        <script>
            function loopfunction() {
              alert("Having trouble with for-loops and do-while loops!");
            }
            </script>
        
        


    </ol>
